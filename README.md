Snake Game in Python

This project is a classic Snake game implemented in Python. It provides a fun and interactive gaming experience where players control a snake and navigate it through a grid, aiming to eat food and grow longer without colliding with the boundaries of the game or the snake's own body.

Key Features:

Intuitive controls: Use arrow keys or WASD to control the snake's movement.
Dynamic gameplay: The snake's length increases as it consumes food, presenting an increasing challenge.
Score tracking: Keep track of your score as you progress through the game.
Game over conditions: The game ends if the snake collides with the boundaries or itself, with an option to restart and try again.
Adjustable speed: Adjust the game's speed to your preference for a more relaxed or intense gaming experience.
